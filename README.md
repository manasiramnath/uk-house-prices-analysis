## Note on data

All raw and cleaned data, as well as descriptive/regression outputs, are stored in the Z-drive (Z:\Interns Work Area\Manasi Ramnath\UK House Prices).
Final merged dataset is saved as 'final_merged_data_cleaned.RDS' in UK House Prices -> 2. cache -> cleaned.

config/settings.R specifies paths to these directories, do let me know if there are any issues loading in dataset!
