## Note on data

All raw and cleaned data, as well as descriptive/regression outputs, are stored in the Z-drive (Z:\Interns Work Area\Manasi Ramnath\UK House Prices).
Final merged dataset is saved as 'final_merged_data_cleaned.RDS' in UK House Prices -> 2. cache -> cleaned.

config/settings.R specifies paths to these directories

scripts/1. Data prep.R contains all the merging and cleaning, and scripts/2. Data desc.R and scripts/3. Data modelling.R contains the analysis. Do let me know if there are any issues loading anything!
